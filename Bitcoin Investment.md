# ⚡️ The Bitcoin Capital Allocation Directive

## Executive Summary
**Bitcoin is not a tech stock; it is a liquidity sponge.**
Its price is strictly determined by the abundance of fiat currency relative to its fixed supply.
To win, you must invert your thinking: **Macro** dictates the direction, **On-Chain Data** confirms the conviction, and **Technicals** provide the entry.

## 1. The Macro Thesis (The "When")
*Do not fight the ocean. Swim with the tide.*

Bitcoin acts as an inverse liquidity gauge. It rallies when money is cheap and abundant.
**The Formula:** `Price = Global M2 Supply / 21 Million`

### The Green Light Signals 🟢
*   **Global M2 Expansion:** Central banks are printing money (QE).
*   **Weak DXY (Dollar Index):** The dollar is weakening (< 102).
*   **Negative Real Rates:** Inflation is higher than bond yields (Cash is trash).

### The Red Light Signals 🔴
*   **Global M2 Contraction:** Central banks are tightening (QT).
*   **Strong DXY:** The dollar is crushing other assets (> 106).
*   **Positive Real Rates:** You get paid to hold cash.

## 2. The On-Chain Fundamentals (The "What")
*Don't trust the price; trust the movement of coins.*

Before you buy, ask: **"Who is holding the chips?"**

### A. Accumulation vs. Distribution
*   **Bullish:** **Long-Term Holders (LTH)** are accumulating while price dips.
    *   *Meaning:* Smart money is buying from panicking retail.
*   **Bearish:** **LTHs** are selling into a rally.
    *   *Meaning:* Smart money is looking for exit liquidity.

### B. Valuation (MVRV Z-Score)
*   **The Buy Zone (Score < 0):** Everyone is underwater. Capitulation has happened. **Maximum Opportunity.**
*   **The Sell Zone (Score > 3.7):** Everyone is rich. Euphoria is peaking. **Maximum Risk.**

### C. Supply Shock (Exchange Reserves)
*   **Bullish:** Coins are leaving exchanges (moving to cold storage). Supply is vanishing.
*   **Bearish:** Coins are flooding onto exchanges. Whales are preparing to sell.

## 3. The Technical Trigger (The "Where")
*Precision matters. Don't catch a falling knife.*

### A. Trend Identification (The Filter)
*   **Weekly/Daily EMA:**
    *   **Price > EMA:** The trend is UP. **Longs only.**
    *   **Price < EMA:** The trend is DOWN. **Cash or Shorts.**

### B. Momentum Entry
*   **RSI Divergence (The Golden Signal):**
    *   **Bullish Divergence:** Price makes a Lower Low, but RSI makes a Higher Low. **STRONG BUY.**
    *   **Bearish Divergence:** Price makes a Higher High, but RSI makes a Lower High. **STRONG SELL.**

---

## 4. Risk Protocols (The Survival Guide)
*You cannot compound if you go to zero.*

### The Iron Laws
1.  **Stop Loss:** Mandatory. No trade exists without an invalidation point.
2.  **Position Size:** Risk **1-2%** of equity per trade. Never more.
3.  **Leverage:**
    *   **Spot:** Safe.
    *   **3x:** Aggressive.
    *   **>10x:** Gambling.
