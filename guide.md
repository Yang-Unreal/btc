## III. THE MATHEMATICAL ENGINE (Kelly + Volatility)

You must pass every trade through this **Double-Check Protocol** before execution.

**Step 1: The Kelly Check (Aggression Ceiling)**
*   Look at the "Max Alloc" in the Master Matrix above.
*   *Example:* Buying PEPE on a breakout. Max Alloc is **15%**.
*   **Math:** `Total Equity * 15% = Maximum Position Size`.

**Step 2: The Volatility Check (Survival Floor)**
*   Calculate the distance from **Entry Price** to **Stop Loss**.
*   **Math:** `Position Size * % Distance to Stop = Potential Dollar Loss`.
*   **Rule:** The Potential Dollar Loss must **NOT exceed 2.5%** of your Total Equity.
    *   *If it does:* **Reduce Position Size** until the loss is < 2.5% of Equity.
    *   *If it does not:* **Execute Trade.**

> **Commander's Note:** Step 1 makes you rich (Geometry). Step 2 keeps you alive (Survival). Never skip Step 2.

## IV. TACTICAL PROTOCOLS

### Protocol A: The "Free Ride" (For Berserkers)
*   **Target:** PEPE, RENDER, VIRTUAL, SUI.
*   **Action:** When PnL = +100% (Price Doubles), sell **50%** of the position.
*   **Logic:** You have removed your principal. You now hold a risk-free moonshot. Hold the remainder until the trend breaks (e.g., Close < 10 EMA).

### Protocol B: The "Late Entry" (FOMO Correction)
*   **Situation:** You missed the 20-Day High breakout. Price is higher.
*   **Logic:** Do not chase unless the math still works.
*   **Check:** Is the distance to the Stop Loss (e.g., 10 EMA) > **20%**?
    *   **YES:** **ABORT.** Set a Limit Order at the 10 EMA (Buy the dip).
    *   **NO:** **EXECUTE.** But you must use the *Volatility Check* (Step 2 above) to size down the position so your dollar risk remains constant.

### Protocol C: The "Sector Rotation"
*   **Situation:** RENDER has pumped, but TAO is flat.
*   **Action:** Do not chase the leader. Buy the laggard in the same sector *before* the breakout signal triggers, using a Left-Side allocation.

## V. THE DAILY ROUTINE (08:00 AM)

**1. The Macro Gate (BTC)**
*   Is **BTC > 21 Weekly EMA**?
    *   🔴 **NO:** **Defensive Mode.** Only "Left-Side" Limit Orders are allowed. No chasing breakouts.
    *   🟢 **YES:** **Berserk Mode.** Aggressive "Right-Side" breakouts are authorized.

**2. The Kill Switch**
*   Check existing positions. Did any asset Close below its **Exit Protocol** line yesterday?
    *   **YES:** **Market Sell immediately.** No thinking. No hoping.

**3. The Hunt**
*   Scan the Titan 9.
*   Are any near a **20-Day High**? -> Set Alerts (Prepare the Army).
*   Are any near **Deep Support**? -> Set Limit Orders (Deploy the Scout).

### VI. FINAL OATH

> "I am a Sovereign Individual. I accept that the market is a pendulum. I will buy fear with calculation, and I will ride greed with discipline. I respect the math of Kelly, and I respect the unforgiving nature of volatility. I will not die on a single bet."

**Good hunting, Commander.**
